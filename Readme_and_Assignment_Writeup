Homework done for the Python Pandas unit. Included is the csv file that the assignment and project file are based on. 
Below are three inferences from data, as requested by the assignment:

1. Although the game has a population of players larger than the purchase data document would suggest, this is because not every player
made a microtransactional purchase. Of course, when they did, they tended to spend extra on other things. 
2. While the population of this hypothetical MMO being analyzed is overwhelmingly male, the female and nondisclosed/other gender segments
actually spend roughly 50 cents more than males on average per player (This amounts to about a 12% increase compared to the average male 
player that's made a purchase in game)
3. The most profitable and most purchased items had a suspiciously high amount of correlation to each other; three out of five items are
the same across both lists (Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm, Nirvana, and Fiery Glass Crusader) with Oathbreaker topping 
both lists. This could be regarding their gamebreaking potential, attractive/cool appearances, or both.
